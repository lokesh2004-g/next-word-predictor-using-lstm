#  Keyword-Based Next Word Predictor (LSTM)

This project is a **next-word prediction model** built using an **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** neural network. Given a keyword or input phrase, the model predicts the most likely next word based on training data.

##  Features

- Uses **LSTM** for sequence modeling.
- Trained on custom or public text corpus.
- Accepts a **keyword or phrase** and predicts the next likely word.
- Easily extendable and customizable.

##  Model Architecture

- Embedding Layer
- LSTM Layer
- Dense Output Layer with Softmax

The model learns to predict the next word based on context from the input sequence.

##  Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy
- (Optional) NLTK or spaCy for text preprocessing

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy
